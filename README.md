# Advanced PyTorch Techniques

Welcome to the Advanced PyTorch Techniques repository! This collection of Jupyter Notebooks is designed for individuals who have a foundational understanding of PyTorch and seek to deepen their knowledge in specific, advanced areas of deep learning. Each notebook dives into a different topic, explaining the concepts and providing implementation examples to illustrate how these techniques can be applied in PyTorch.

## Topics Covered

Below is a list of the topics we've explored so far, each encapsulated in its own Jupyter Notebook:

- **Dynamic Computation Graphs in PyTorch**:
  Dive into how PyTorch's dynamic computation graph (Autograd) works and how it differs from static graphs, providing flexibility and ease of use for dynamic model architecture adjustments.

- **PyTorch Lightning**:
  An overview and implementation guide for PyTorch Lightning, a lightweight PyTorch wrapper that helps organize your deep learning code and makes your models hardware-agnostic.

- **Learning Rate Schedulers in PyTorch**:
  Explore different learning rate scheduling techniques to improve your training process in PyTorch, including step decay, exponential decay, and more.

- **Mixed Precision Training in PyTorch**:
  Learn how to implement mixed precision training in PyTorch to speed up training times and reduce memory usage while maintaining the accuracy of your models.

## Getting Started

To get started with these notebooks, you'll need a working installation of PyTorch. We recommend setting up a virtual environment and installing PyTorch and its dependencies as follows:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

## Contribution
